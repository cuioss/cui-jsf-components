# Task 5: Create README According to Standards

This document provides detailed guidance for implementing Task 5 of the CUI JSF Components maintenance plan: creating README files according to CUI standards.

## Overview

The goal of this task is to ensure each module in the CUI JSF Components project has a standardized README file that provides clear information about the module's purpose, usage, and features. This will improve documentation and make it easier for developers to understand and use the modules.

## Pre-conditions

- Module may not have a standardized README or it may be incomplete
- Information about the module's purpose and usage may be lacking
- Installation and configuration instructions may be missing
- Examples and API documentation may be insufficient

## Post-conditions

- Each module has a README file following the CUI README structure
- README provides clear information about the module's purpose, usage, and features
- Documentation is comprehensive and user-friendly
- No code changes should be made during this task

## README Standards

The following standards should be applied to all README files:

### Basic Structure

README files should follow this basic structure:

1. **Title and Description**: Clear module name and concise description
2. **Motivation**: Why the module exists and what problem it solves
3. **Usage**: How to use the module with examples

### Content Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language
- Avoid verbosity - for details always provide links to the source code
- Include code examples for common use cases
- Provide links to more detailed documentation
- Use proper AsciiDoc formatting
- Include screenshots or diagrams where helpful
- Keep information up-to-date with the current version

### Module-Specific Requirements

For JSF component modules, include the following sections:

#### Title and Brief Description
- Module name as title (level 1 heading)
- Concise description of purpose and key functionality
- High-level overview of module's role in the system

#### Maven Coordinates
- Must be placed immediately after description
- Complete dependency block in XML format
- Include group and artifact IDs

```asciidoc
[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>group.id</groupId>
    <artifactId>artifact-id</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
```

#### Core Concepts
- Key architectural components
- Main features and capabilities
- Integration points
- Each concept with bullet points for details
- Links to source files where appropriate

#### Detailed Component Documentation
- Each major component with its own section
- Links to source files using AsciiDoc format: `link:path/to/file[ComponentName]`
- Feature lists and capabilities
- Technical details and requirements
- Implementation considerations

#### Usage Examples
- Complete, working code examples
- Common use cases
- Configuration examples
- Best practice implementations
- Each example must have:
  - Clear purpose explanation
  - Complete code snippet
  - Configuration if required
  - Expected outcome

## Implementation Process

For implementing this task, follow the refactoring process:

### 1. Analysis Phase

- Review current state of the module's documentation
- Identify gaps between current implementation and standards
- Document specific issues to be addressed

### 2. Planning Phase

- Define specific content needed for the README
- Gather information about the module's purpose, usage, and features
- Identify examples and code snippets to include

### 3. Implementation Phase

- Create or update the README file
- Follow the pre and post conditions strictly
- Keep changes focused on the specific task
- Do not modify code

### 4. Verification Phase

- Review the README for completeness and accuracy
- Verify that standards are now being followed
- Document any remaining issues
- Verify the AsciiDoc grammar thoroughly

## Progress Tracking

For each module, progress should be tracked in the module-specific maintenance document:

- **Not Started**: Task has not been initiated
- **In Progress**: Task is currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Task has been completed and verified
- **Blocked**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues
