# Task 5: Create README According to Standards

This document provides detailed guidance for implementing Task 5 of the CUI JSF Components maintenance plan: creating README files according to CUI standards.

## Overview

The goal of this task is to ensure each module in the CUI JSF Components project has a standardized README file that provides clear information about the module's purpose, usage, and features. This will improve documentation and make it easier for developers to understand and use the modules.

## Pre-conditions

- Module may not have a standardized README or it may be incomplete
- Information about the module's purpose and usage may be lacking
- Installation and configuration instructions may be missing
- Examples and API documentation may be insufficient

## Post-conditions

- Each module has a README file following the CUI README structure
- README provides clear information about the module's purpose, usage, and features
- Documentation is comprehensive and user-friendly
- No code changes have been made during this task

## README Standards

The following standards should be applied to all README files:

### Basic Structure

README files should follow this basic structure:

1. **Title and Description**: Clear module name and concise description
2. **Status Badges**: Build status, test coverage, etc. (if applicable)
3. **Motivation**: Why the module exists and what problem it solves
4. **Installation**: How to add the module as a dependency
5. **Usage**: How to use the module with examples
6. **API Documentation**: Overview of key classes and methods
7. **Configuration**: Configuration options and defaults
8. **Dependencies**: Major dependencies and version requirements
9. **Contributing**: Guidelines for contributing (if applicable)
10. **License**: License information

### Content Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples for common use cases
- Provide links to more detailed documentation
- Use proper Markdown formatting
- Include screenshots or diagrams where helpful
- Keep information up-to-date with the current version

### Module-Specific Requirements

For JSF component modules, also include:

- Component usage examples with code snippets
- Available attributes and their descriptions
- Client-side behavior documentation
- Styling and CSS information
- Browser compatibility notes

## Implementation Process

For implementing this task, follow the refactoring process:

### 1. Analysis Phase

- Review current state of the module's documentation
- Identify gaps between current implementation and standards
- Document specific issues to be addressed

### 2. Planning Phase

- Define specific content needed for the README
- Gather information about the module's purpose, usage, and features
- Identify examples and code snippets to include

### 3. Implementation Phase

- Create or update the README file
- Follow the pre and post conditions strictly
- Keep changes focused on the specific task
- Do not modify code

### 4. Verification Phase

- Review the README for completeness and accuracy
- Verify that standards are now being followed
- Document any remaining issues

## Progress Tracking

For each module, progress should be tracked in the module-specific maintenance document:

- **Not Started**: Task has not been initiated
- **In Progress**: Task is currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Task has been completed and verified
- **Blocked**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues
