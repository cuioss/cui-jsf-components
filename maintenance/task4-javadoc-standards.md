# Task 4: Update Javadoc to Comply with Standards

This document provides detailed guidance for implementing Task 4 of the CUI JSF Components maintenance plan: updating Javadoc to comply with CUI documentation standards.

## Overview

The goal of this task is to ensure all Javadoc across the CUI JSF Components project follows the established CUI documentation standards. This includes updating class, method, and field documentation to provide clear, consistent, and comprehensive information for developers.

## Pre-conditions

- Existing Javadoc may not follow CUI documentation standards
- Documentation may be incomplete or outdated
- Javadoc formatting may be inconsistent
- Important details may be missing from documentation

## Post-conditions

- All Javadoc follows CUI documentation standards
- Documentation is complete for all public classes, methods, and interfaces
- Javadoc provides clear and useful information
- No functional code changes have been made during this task

## Javadoc Standards

The following standards should be applied to all Javadoc:

### Class Documentation

- Every public class/interface must be documented
- Include clear purpose statement in class documentation
- Document thread-safety considerations
- Include `@since` tag with version information
- Every package should have package-info.java

### Method Documentation

- Document all public methods with parameters, returns, and exceptions
- Use `@param` tags for all parameters
- Use `@return` tag to describe the return value (except for void methods)
- Use `@throws` tags for all checked exceptions
- Use `{@link}` for references to classes, methods, and fields

### Field Documentation

- Document all public fields
- Explain the purpose and usage of each field
- Document any constraints or valid values

### Code Examples

- Include usage examples for complex classes and methods
- Document Builder classes with complete usage examples
- Ensure examples are correct and follow best practices

## Implementation Process

For implementing this task, follow the refactoring process:

### 1. Analysis Phase

- Review current state of the module's Javadoc
- Identify gaps between current implementation and standards
- Document specific issues to be addressed

### 2. Planning Phase

- Define specific changes needed for each class
- Prioritize classes based on importance and complexity
- Estimate effort required

### 3. Implementation Phase

- Make the necessary changes to Javadoc
- Follow the pre and post conditions strictly
- Keep changes focused on the specific task
- Do not modify functional code

### 4. Verification Phase

- Run Javadoc generation to ensure no errors
- Verify that standards are now being followed
- Document any remaining issues

## Progress Tracking

For each module, progress should be tracked in the module-specific maintenance document:

- **Not Started**: Task has not been initiated
- **In Progress**: Task is currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Task has been completed and verified
- **Blocked**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues

## Javadoc Verification

Use the following command to verify Javadoc quality:
```
./mvnw clean install -Pjavadoc-mm-reporting
```

Check the console after running the command and fix all errors and warnings, verify until they are all corrected.
