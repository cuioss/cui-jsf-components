== Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive logging standards for all CUI projects. These standards serve as independent, authoritative sources of truth for logging requirements without being tied to specific implementation processes. They ensure consistent, traceable, and maintainable logging across the codebase.

== Document Structure

The logging standards are organized into the following documents:

* xref:core-standards.adoc[Core Standards] - Fundamental logging configuration and implementation requirements
* xref:implementation-guide.adoc[Implementation Guide] - Standards for implementing logging functionality
* xref:testing-guide.adoc[Testing Guide] - Standards for testing logging implementations

== Key Principles

1. *Consistency*: All logging follows the same patterns and conventions
2. *Traceability*: Each log message has a unique identifier and is documented
3. *Testability*: All log messages are verified through automated tests
4. *Maintainability*: Log messages are organized in a discoverable, hierarchical structure

|Message Format
|Use `LogRecord` for structured logging with '%s' for string substitutions

|Testing
|Use `cui-test-juli-logger` and `LogAsserts` methods for verification
