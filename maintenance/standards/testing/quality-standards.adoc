== Purpose

This document defines comprehensive quality standards, testing framework guidelines, and quality verification processes for CUI OSS projects.

== Core Testing Standards

=== Test Structure and Organization

* Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
* One logical assertion per test
* Clear test naming convention
* Descriptive test documentation
* Independent test execution
* Clean test environment
* Predictable test data

=== Coverage Requirements

* Minimum 80% line coverage
* Minimum 80% branch coverage
* Critical paths must have 100% coverage
* All public APIs must be tested
* Edge cases must be covered
* No coverage regressions allowed
* Regular coverage review
* Use Maven profile `-Pcoverage` for verifying coverage metrics

=== Testing Tools and Frameworks

==== Required Frameworks

1. JUnit 5
   * Use `@DisplayName` for readable test names
   * Leverage parameterized tests (see <<parameterized-tests-best-practices,Parameterized Tests Best Practices>>)
   * Apply proper test lifecycle annotations

==== CUI Testing Utilities

1. https://github.com/cuioss/cui-test-generator[cui-test-generator]
   * Use for generating test data
   * Follow builder patterns
   * Document generator configurations

2. https://github.com/cuioss/cui-test-value-objects[cui-test-value-objects]
   * Leverage for value object testing
   * Follow equality testing guidelines
   * Include serialization tests

3. https://github.com/cuioss/cui-jsf-test-basic[cui-jsf-test-basic]
   * Use for JSF component testing
   * Follow component test patterns
   * Include lifecycle tests

4. https://github.com/cuioss/cui-test-mockwebserver-junit5[cui-test-mockwebserver-junit5]
   * Use for testing HTTP client interactions
   * Mock HTTP server responses
   * Test request/response handling

=== Test Categories

==== Unit Tests

* Test single units in isolation
* Mock all dependencies
* Fast execution
* High maintainability

==== Integration Tests

* Test component interactions
* Minimal mocking
* Cover critical paths
* Include error scenarios
* Regular maintenance required

==== System Tests

* End-to-end scenarios
* Real dependencies where possible
* Cover main user flows
* Include performance criteria

== Quality Verification

=== Quality Analysis Tools

* SonarCloud for static code analysis
* JUnit for unit testing
* Mutation testing for test quality
* Regular code reviews
* Continuous integration checks

=== Quality Metrics

* Code coverage
* Code duplication
* Complexity metrics
* Issue density
* Technical debt ratio

=== Best Practices

==== Test Quality

* Regular test review
* Mutation testing
* Test failure analysis
* DRY in test utilities
* Clear test documentation
* Consistent patterns

=== Parameterized Tests Best Practices

* *Minimum Test Cases*: Parameterized tests should have at least 3 test cases to justify the overhead
** For fewer than 3 test cases, use direct test methods instead
** Convert existing parameterized tests with fewer than 3 cases to direct methods

* *Method Source Organization*:
** Use descriptive method names for test case providers
** Group related test cases together
** Document each test case's purpose in the provider method
** Return `Stream<Arguments>` with clear parameter descriptions
** *Limit to test data only*: Method sources should only provide input data, expected outputs, and optionally error messages
** *Avoid strategy pattern*: Do not use method sources to implement different testing strategies or behaviors

* *Test Case Naming*:
** Use the `name` parameter in `@ParameterizedTest` for descriptive test names
** Include parameter values in the name template where appropriate
** Example: `@ParameterizedTest(name = "{0}: {1} should result in {2}")`

* *Test Case Documentation*:
** Document the purpose of each test case in the provider method
** Include edge cases and boundary conditions
** Explain the relationship between inputs and expected outputs

* *Maintenance Considerations*:
** Regularly review parameterized tests for relevance
** Avoid excessive parameterization that obscures test intent
** Balance between coverage and maintainability
** Refactor tests that use method sources as strategy patterns into separate test methods

=== Performance

* Fast test execution
* Efficient resource usage
* Parallel test execution where possible
* Regular performance monitoring

=== Review Process

Regular Review Points:

* After major feature completion
* Before creating pull requests
* During code review process
* Post-merge verification

=== Documentation

* Record quality findings
* Document remediation steps
* Note technical debt decisions
* Update quality metrics
* Track coverage changes

== Success Criteria

=== Test Coverage

* All coverage requirements met
* Critical paths fully covered
* Test quality sufficient
* No coverage regressions

=== Quality Analysis

* All quality gates passed
* New issues addressed
* Impact assessed
* Clear remediation paths
* Documentation complete

=== Security

* No critical vulnerabilities
* Security hotspots reviewed
* Dependencies verified
* Security standards met

== Maven Coverage Profile

To verify code coverage in your project, use the Maven profile `-Pcoverage`:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean verify -Pcoverage
----

This profile will:

* Enable JaCoCo code coverage analysis
* Generate detailed coverage reports
* Enforce minimum coverage thresholds
* Fail the build if coverage requirements are not met
