== Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive testing standards for all CUI projects. These standards serve as independent, authoritative sources of truth for testing requirements without being tied to specific implementation processes. They ensure consistent, thorough, and maintainable testing across the codebase.

== Document Structure

The testing standards are organized into the following documents:

* xref:core-standards.adoc[Core Standards] - Fundamental testing standards and requirements
* xref:quality-standards.adoc[Quality Standards] - Standards for test quality and coverage
* xref:../logging/testing-guide.adoc[Logging Testing Guide] - Standards for testing logging implementations

== Key Principles

1. *Comprehensive Coverage*: All code should have appropriate test coverage
2. *Maintainability*: Tests should be easy to understand and maintain
3. *Reliability*: Tests should be deterministic and not flaky
4. *Efficiency*: Tests should run quickly and use resources efficiently
