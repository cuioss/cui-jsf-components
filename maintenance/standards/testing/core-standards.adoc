== Purpose

This document defines the core standards and best practices for writing and maintaining tests across all CUI projects.

== Related Documentation

* xref:README.adoc[Testing Standards Overview]
* xref:../logging/testing-guide.adoc[Logging Testing Guide]
* xref:../documentation/javadoc-standards.adoc[Javadoc Standards]

== Core Testing Principles

=== Test Coverage

* All public methods must have unit tests
* All business logic must have appropriate test coverage
* Edge cases and error conditions must be tested
* Test coverage should aim for at least 80% line coverage

=== Test Independence

* Tests must be independent and not rely on other tests
* Tests must not depend on execution order
* Tests must clean up after themselves
* Tests must not have side effects that affect other tests

=== Test Clarity

* Test names must clearly describe what is being tested
* Test methods should follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
* Each test should test one specific behavior
* Comments should explain complex test setups or assertions

=== Test Maintenance

* Tests must be maintained alongside production code
* Failing tests must be fixed promptly
* Tests should be refactored when production code changes
* Test code should follow the same quality standards as production code

== Test Types

=== Unit Tests

* Focus on testing a single unit of code in isolation
* Mock or stub dependencies
* Should be fast and lightweight
* Should cover all code paths

=== Integration Tests

* Test interaction between components
* May use real dependencies or test doubles
* Should verify correct integration behavior
* Should be isolated from external systems when possible

=== System Tests

* Test the entire system as a whole
* Verify end-to-end functionality
* May involve multiple components and services
* Should simulate real-world usage

== Test Code Changes

=== Scope of Changes

When adapting test code (e.g., to new logging standards), changes must be strictly limited to the test-related modifications:

* DO NOT modify production code that is unrelated to the current task
* DO NOT refactor or "improve" other aspects of the code while working on test changes
* Each change should have a single, clear purpose

.Example - Updating tests for new logging standard
[source,java]
----
// CORRECT - Only change logging related code
- import static de.cuioss.portal.core.PortalCoreLogMessages.SERVLET;  // New import
- assertLogMessagePresentContaining(TestLogLevel.WARN, SERVLET.WARN.USER_NOT_LOGGED_IN);  // Updated assertion

// INCORRECT - Making unrelated changes
- Refactoring test method names
- Changing test data structures
- Modifying production code formatting
- Adding new test cases unrelated to logging
----

=== Implementation Guidelines

==== Change Strategy

* Identify all affected test files
* Plan changes before implementation
* Make changes systematically and consistently
* Review changes to ensure they stay within scope

==== Documentation

* Document the specific purpose of test changes
* Note any test-specific configurations or requirements
* Keep commit messages focused on the test changes

=== Quality Assurance

==== Verification

* Run affected test suites
* Verify only intended changes were made
* Check for unintended side effects
* Ensure test coverage remains consistent

==== Review Process

* Separate test changes from production code changes
* Focus review on the specific test modifications
* Ensure changes adhere to testing standards

== Best Practices

=== Test Organization

* Group related tests in the same test class
* Use descriptive test method names
* Follow a consistent naming convention
* Organize tests in a logical order

=== Test Data

* Use meaningful test data
* Avoid hardcoded values
* Consider edge cases
* Use test data builders when appropriate

=== Assertions

* Use specific assertions
* Include meaningful error messages
* Verify only what is necessary
* Use assertion libraries appropriately

== Important Notes

* All rules are normative and must be applied unconditionally
* Test code should be treated with the same care as production code
* Tests should be maintainable and readable
* Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details
