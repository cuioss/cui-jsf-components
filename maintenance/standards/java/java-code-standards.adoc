== Purpose

This document defines general best practices and standards for writing Java code in CUI projects. These standards ensure consistent, maintainable, and high-quality code across all Java projects.

* xref:../documentation/javadoc-standards.adoc[Javadoc Standards]
* xref:../logging/implementation-guide.adoc[Logging Implementation Guide]

== General Principles

. *Code Readability*: Write code that is easy to read and understand
. *Maintainability*: Design code that is easy to modify and extend
. *Consistency*: Follow consistent patterns across the codebase
. *Testability*: Write code that is easy to test
. *Performance*: Consider performance implications in design decisions

== Code Organization

=== Package Structure

. Use reverse domain name notation for package names
. Organize packages by feature rather than layer
. Keep package cohesion high

=== Class Structure

. Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
. Keep classes small and focused
. Use proper access modifiers (public, protected, private)

=== Method Design

. Keep methods short and focused
. Use meaningful method names
. Follow the Command-Query Separation principle

== Coding Practices

=== Naming Conventions

. Use meaningful and descriptive names
. Follow standard Java naming conventions
. Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood

=== Exception Handling

. Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions
. Use unchecked exceptions for programming errors
. Don't catch generic Exception
. Include meaningful error messages

=== Documentation

. Follow Javadoc standards (see xref:../documentation/javadoc-standards.adoc[Javadoc Standards])

== Best Practices

. Prefer immutable objects
. Use final fields where appropriate
. Consider using records for data carriers
. Use interface types for declarations
. Prefer immutable collections
. Use appropriate collection types for use cases
. Use streams for complex data transformations
. Keep lambda expressions short and clear
. Avoid side effects in streams
. Always use the most recent features from the version to compile against (e.g., usage of Record-classes for Java 17)
. Use Lombok where sensible
. Prefer delegation over inheritance.
. Prefer Imports over fully qualified class names. Where applicable

=== Using Lombok

Lombok can help reduce boilerplate code and improve readability. Here are some guidelines on when to use specific Lombok annotations:

. Use `@Delegate` for delegation over inheritance:
[source,java]
----
public class Printer {
    @Delegate
    private final PrinterService printerService = new PrinterServiceImpl();
}
----

. Use `@Builder` for building complex objects:
[source,java]
----
@Builder
public class User {
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
}
----

. Use `@Value` for immutable objects:
[source,java]
----
@Value
public class Address {
    String street;
    String city;
    String zipCode;
}
----

== Best Practices Examples

=== Using Records for Data Carriers

[source,java]
----
public record User(String id, String name, String email) {}
----

=== Using Streams for Complex Data Transformations

[source,java]
----
List<String> names = users.stream()
    .filter(user -> user.getAge() > 18)
    .map(User::getName)
    .sorted()
    .toList();
----

=== Keeping Lambda Expressions Short and Clear

[source,java]
----
List<Integer> lengths = strings.stream()
    .map(String::length)
    .toList();
----

=== Avoiding Side Effects in Streams

[source,java]
----
// Avoid this
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
users.stream().forEach(user -> names.add(user.getName()));

// Prefer this
List<String> names = users.stream()
    .map(User::getName)
    .toList();
