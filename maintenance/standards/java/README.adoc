== Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive Java standards for all CUI projects. These standards serve as independent, authoritative sources of truth for Java development requirements without being tied to specific implementation processes. They ensure consistent, maintainable, and high-quality Java code across the codebase.

== Document Structure

The Java standards are organized into the following documents:

* xref:java-code-standards.adoc[Java Code Standards] - Standards for writing Java code
* xref:dsl-style-constants.adoc[DSL-Style Constants Pattern] - Standards for organizing constants in a hierarchical manner

== Key Principles

1. *Consistency*: All Java code follows the same patterns and conventions
2. *Maintainability*: Code is organized for long-term maintenance
3. *Readability*: Code is easy to read and understand
4. *Testability*: Code is designed to be easily testable
