= Project Planning Standards

== Purpose

This document defines the standards for project planning documentation. It establishes a consistent structure for tracking planned work, implementation tasks, and progress without prescribing specific implementation processes.

== Planning Document Structure

=== Location and Naming

* Planning documentation should be stored in the `doc/` directory of the project
* The primary planning document should be named `TODO.adoc`
* The document should use AsciiDoc format with proper heading structure

=== Document Header

The planning document should include a standardized header:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Project Name TODO List
:toc:
:toclevels: 3
:toc-title: Table of Contents
:sectnums:
----

=== Content Organization

The planning document should be organized with the following sections:

==== Overview Section

Begin with a brief overview that explains the purpose of the document:

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Overview

This document lists the actionable tasks that need to be completed to fully implement the [Project Name] according to the specifications.
----

==== Implementation Tasks Section

Group tasks by functional areas:

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Implementation Tasks

=== Core Components

==== [Component Name]
_See Requirement [REQ-ID]: [Requirement Name] in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements]_

* [ ] [Task description]
* [ ] [Task description]
* _Note: [Additional context or implementation notes]_
----

==== Testing Section

Include a dedicated section for testing tasks:

[source,asciidoc]
----
=== Testing
_See link:specification/testing.adoc#_section_name[Relevant Testing Section]_

==== [Testing Category]
_See link:specification/testing.adoc#_specific_section[Specific Testing Section]_

* [ ] [Testing task description]
* [ ] [Testing task description]
----

==== Additional Sections

Add sections for other categories as needed:

* Security
* Documentation
* Performance
* Compliance

== Task Tracking Format

=== Task Status Indicators

Use the following format for tracking task status:

* `[ ]` - Task not started or in progress
* `[x]` - Task completed
* `[~]` - Task partially completed
* `[!]` - Task blocked or has issues

=== Task References

Each task or task group should include references to relevant requirements or specifications:

[source,asciidoc]
----
==== [Component/Feature Name]
_See Requirement [REQ-ID]: [Requirement Name] in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements]_
----

=== Implementation Notes

Include implementation notes where appropriate to provide context:

[source,asciidoc]
----
* _Note: [Additional context or implementation notes]_
* _Important: [Critical information about implementation]_
----

== Relationship to Other Documentation

The planning document should reference and be linked to:

* Requirements documentation
* Specification documents
* Design documents

This creates a traceable relationship between requirements, specifications, and implementation tasks.

== Implementation Tasks

=== Core Components

==== Component A
_See Requirement REQ-1.1: Component A Requirements in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements]_

* [ ] Implement feature X
* [ ] Implement feature Y
* _Note: Feature Z is optional for the first release_

==== Component B
_See Requirement REQ-2.1: Component B Requirements in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements]_

* [x] Implement feature M
* [ ] Implement feature N
* _Important: Feature N depends on Component A being completed first_

=== Testing

==== Unit Testing
_See link:specification/testing.adoc#_unit_testing[Unit Testing Specification]_

* [ ] Implement tests for Component A
* [x] Implement tests for Component B

==== Integration Testing
_See link:specification/testing.adoc#_integration_testing[Integration Testing Specification]_

* [ ] Implement end-to-end tests
* [ ] Implement performance tests

=== Security

==== Security Hardening
_See Requirement REQ-5.1: Security Requirements in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements]_

* [ ] Implement input validation
* [ ] Implement authentication checks
