= Creating a New Project with Requirements and Specifications
:toc: left
:toclevels: 3
:sectnums:

== Purpose
This document defines the standards for requirements and specification documentation in new projects.

== Directory Structure Standards

. Create the basic directory structure:
+
[source]
----
project-root/
├── doc/
│   ├── Requirements.adoc
│   ├── Specification.adoc
│   ├── LogMessages.adoc
│   └── specification/
│       ├── technical-components.adoc
│       ├── configuration.adoc
│       ├── error-handling.adoc
│       ├── testing.adoc
│       ├── security.adoc
│       ├── integration-patterns.adoc
│       └── internationalization.adoc
----

. Determine the requirement prefix:
.. Choose a short, meaningful prefix (3-5 characters)
.. Recommended prefixes:
... `NIFI-` for Apache NiFi related projects
... `SEC-` for security-related projects
... `API-` for API-related projects
... `UI-` for user interface projects
... `DB-` for database projects
... `INT-` for integration projects
.. Custom prefixes should be relevant to the project domain

== Requirements Document Standards

. Set up the Requirements.adoc file:
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
= Project Name Requirements
:toc:
:toclevels: 3
:toc-title: Table of Contents
:sectnums:

== Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the Project Name, a component designed to...

== General Requirements

[#PREFIX-1]
=== PREFIX-1: Project Overview
* High-level requirement 1
* High-level requirement 2
* High-level requirement 3

[#PREFIX-2]
=== PREFIX-2: Core Functionality
* Core functionality requirement 1
* Core functionality requirement 2
* Core functionality requirement 3

[#PREFIX-2.1]
==== PREFIX-2.1: Sub-requirement
* Detailed requirement 1
* Detailed requirement 2
----

. Organize requirements into logical sections:
.. General Requirements
.. Functional Requirements
.. Non-Functional Requirements
.. Component-Specific Requirements

== Specification Document Creation

. Set up the Specification.adoc file:
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
= Project Name Specification
:toc:
:toclevels: 3
:toc-title: Table of Contents
:sectnums:

== Overview
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#PREFIX-1[PREFIX-1: Project Overview]_

This document provides the technical specification for implementing Project Name.
For functional requirements, see link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements Document].

== Document Structure
This specification is organized into the following documents:

* link:specification/technical-components.adoc[Technical Components] - Core implementation details
* link:specification/configuration.adoc[Configuration] - Configuration properties and UI
* link:specification/error-handling.adoc[Error Handling] - Error handling implementation
* link:specification/testing.adoc[Testing] - Unit and integration testing
* link:specification/security.adoc[Security] - Security considerations
* link:specification/integration-patterns.adoc[Integration Patterns] - Integration examples
* link:specification/internationalization.adoc[Internationalization] - i18n implementation
* link:LogMessages.adoc[Log Messages] - Logging standards and implementation
----

. Create individual specification documents:
.. Each document should start with a link back to the main specification
.. Each section should include backtracking links to requirements
.. Follow the established document structure and formatting

== Example Individual Specification Document

= Project Name Technical Components

== Core Components
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#PREFIX-2[PREFIX-2: Core Functionality]_

This section describes the core components of the Project Name implementation.

=== Component 1
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#PREFIX-2.1[PREFIX-2.1: Sub-requirement]_

The Component 1 is responsible for...

[source,java]
----
public class Component1 {
    // Implementation details
}
----
----

== Maintaining Traceability

. Always ensure that each specification section has a backtracking link to a requirement
. When adding new requirements, update the corresponding specification documents
. When updating specifications, ensure they remain aligned with requirements
. Regularly review the documentation to ensure consistency and completeness

== Logging Requirements and Specifications

When implementing logging in a new project:

. Add a dedicated section for logging requirements in the Requirements.adoc file
. Create a dedicated LogMessages.adoc file in the doc directory
. For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the logging standards and implementation guides
