= Requirements Document Structure and Format

== Purpose
Defines the structure and format for requirements documents in CUI projects, ensuring consistency and traceability.

== Document Location and Naming
. Requirements must be located in the project under `doc/Requirements.adoc`
. The document must follow AsciiDoc format with proper headings, sections, and formatting

== Document Structure
. The document must include:
.. Title: `= [Project Name] Requirements`
.. Table of contents: `:toc:`, `:toclevels: 3`, `:toc-title: Table of Contents`, `:sectnums:`
.. Overview section explaining the purpose of the requirements
.. General Requirements section
.. Specific requirements sections organized by component or feature

== Requirements Format
. Each requirement must have a unique ID with a consistent prefix
.. Format: `[#PREFIX-NUM]`
.. Example: `[#NIFI-AUTH-1]`
. Each requirement must have a descriptive title
.. Format: `=== PREFIX-NUM: Descriptive Title`
.. Example: `=== NIFI-AUTH-1: REST API Support Enhancement`
. Requirements must be organized hierarchically
.. Major requirements: Level 3 headings (`===`)
.. Sub-requirements: Level 4 headings (`====`)
. Each requirement must be described using bullet points
.. Main points should be clear and concise
.. Use sub-bullets for additional details
. Each requirement must be traceable to corresponding specification documents
.. Specifications must include backtracking links to requirements
.. Requirements should reference implementation specifications where appropriate

== Requirements Numbering
. Major requirements must use a sequential number (e.g., `PREFIX-1`, `PREFIX-2`)
. Sub-requirements must use a decimal notation (e.g., `PREFIX-1.1`, `PREFIX-1.2`)
. Requirements must maintain a consistent numbering scheme throughout the document
. When adding new requirements, assign the next available number in the sequence
. Never reuse requirement IDs, even if a requirement is removed or replaced
. When a requirement is no longer applicable, mark it as deprecated rather than removing it
.. Format: `=== PREFIX-NUM: [DEPRECATED] Descriptive Title`

== Requirements Content
. Requirements must be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals[SMART principles])
. Requirements must clearly state what is needed, not how it should be implemented
. Requirements must be testable
. Requirements must be traceable to corresponding specification documents
. For logging requirements, refer to the logging standards and ensure requirements align with established standards

== Prefix Selection
. When creating requirements for a new project, prompt the user to select a prefix
. Provide a numbered list of recommended prefixes based on the project domain
. Suggested prefixes should be short (3-5 characters) and relevant to the project
. Example prefixes to recommend:
.. `NIFI-` for Apache NiFi related projects
.. `SEC-` for security-related projects
.. `API-` for API-related projects
.. `UI-` for user interface projects
.. `DB-` for database projects
.. `INT-` for integration projects

== Updating Requirements
. When adding new requirements, maintain the existing structure and formatting
. When modifying requirements, preserve the requirement ID and update only the content
. When removing requirements, mark them as deprecated rather than deleting them
. When refactoring requirements, ensure all specification documents are updated to maintain traceability
