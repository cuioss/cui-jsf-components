= Specification Documents Structure and Format
:toc: left
:toclevels: 3
:sectnums:

== Purpose
Defines the structure and format for specification documents in CUI projects, ensuring consistency and traceability to requirements.

== Document Location and Naming
. The main specification document must be located at `doc/Specification.adoc`
. Individual specification documents must be located in `doc/specification/` directory
. Individual specification documents must follow a consistent naming convention:
.. Use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word names
.. Example: `technical-components.adoc`, `error-handling.adoc`
. All specification documents must follow AsciiDoc format

== Main Specification Document Structure
. The main specification document (`Specification.adoc`) must include:
.. Title: `= [Project Name] Specification`
.. Table of contents: `:toc:`, `:toclevels: 3`, `:toc-title: Table of Contents`, `:sectnums:`
.. Overview section with a backtracking link to the corresponding requirement
.. Document Structure section listing all individual specification documents with links
.. Each section must include a backtracking link to the corresponding requirement

== Individual Specification Document Structure
. Each individual specification document must include:
.. Title: `= [Project Name] [Component/Feature]`
.. Table of contents: `:toc:`, `:toclevels: 3`, `:toc-title: Table of Contents`, `:sectnums:`
.. A link back to the main specification document at the top: `link:../Specification.adoc[Back to Main Specification]`
.. Sections organized by component, feature, or aspect
.. Each section must include a backtracking link to the corresponding requirement

== Backtracking Links Format
. Each specification section must include a backtracking link to the corresponding requirement
. The backtracking link must follow this exact format:
+
[source]
----
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#PREFIX-NUM[PREFIX-NUM: Requirement Title]_
----
. For specification files in subdirectories, use relative paths:
+
[source]
----
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#PREFIX-NUM[PREFIX-NUM: Requirement Title]_
----
. For specification files in the root directory, use direct path:
+
[source]
----
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#PREFIX-NUM[PREFIX-NUM: Requirement Title]_
----
. There must be exactly ONE empty line after each backtracking link before the content begins
. This empty line is required to create a proper paragraph separation in the rendered document

== Specification Content
. Specifications must provide detailed implementation guidance
. Include code examples where appropriate
. Provide diagrams for complex components or workflows
. Reference external documentation when necessary
. Ensure all implementation details are traceable to requirements
