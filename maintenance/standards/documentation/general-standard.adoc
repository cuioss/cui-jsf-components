== Core Documentation Standards

=== General Principles
* Only document existing code elements - no speculative or planned features
* All references must be verified to exist
* Use linking instead of duplication
* Code examples must come from actual unit tests
* Use consistent terminology across all documentation
* All public APIs must be documented
* All changes require successful documentation build

=== Terminology Standards
* Maintain "Java Bean Specification" terminology
* Apply consistently across all documentation types
* Follow project glossary and naming conventions
* Use technical terms consistently

=== Code Example Requirements
==== Technical Requirements
* Must be complete and compilable
* Include all necessary imports
* Show proper error handling
* Follow project coding standards
* Be verified by unit tests

==== Structure Requirements
* Start with setup/configuration
* Show main functionality
* Include error handling
* Demonstrate cleanup if needed
* Use clear variable names
* Include comments for complex steps
