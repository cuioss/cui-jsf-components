== Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive documentation standards for all CUI projects. These standards serve as independent, authoritative sources of truth for documentation requirements without being tied to specific implementation processes. They ensure consistent, thorough, and maintainable documentation across the codebase.

== Document Structure

The documentation standards are organized into the following documents:

* `general-standard.adoc` - Core documentation standards and best practices
* `javadoc-standards.adoc` - Specific standards for Javadoc documentation
* `javadoc-maintenance.adoc` - Standards for Javadoc maintenance and error resolution
* `readme-structure.adoc` - Standard structure for README.adoc files

== Key Principles

1. *Consistency*: All documentation follows the same patterns and conventions
2. *Completeness*: Documentation covers all necessary aspects of the code
3. *Clarity*: Documentation is clear and understandable
4. *Maintainability*: Documentation is easy to update and maintain
