= README.adoc Structure Pattern
:toc: left
:toclevels: 3
:sectnums:

== Purpose
Defines the standard structure for module README.adoc files in CUI projects to ensure consistency and completeness across all repositories.

== Related Documentation
* xref:general-standard.adoc[General Documentation Standards]: Core documentation standards
* xref:javadoc-standards.adoc[Javadoc Standards]: Specific standards for Javadoc documentation
* xref:javadoc-maintenance.adoc[Javadoc Maintenance]: Process for maintaining Javadoc documentation
* xref:../cascade/documentation-management.adoc[Documentation Management]: Rules for documentation management

== Structure Requirements

=== Title and Brief Description
* Module name as title (level 1 heading)
* Concise description of purpose and key functionality
* High-level overview of module's role in the system

=== Maven Coordinates
* Must be placed immediately after description
* Complete dependency block in XML format
* Include group and artifact IDs

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>group.id</groupId>
    <artifactId>artifact-id</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

=== Core Concepts
* Key architectural components
* Main features and capabilities
* Integration points
* Each concept with bullet points for details
* Links to source files where appropriate

=== Detailed Component Documentation
* Each major component with its own section
* Links to source files using asciidoc format: `link:path/to/file[ComponentName]`
* Feature lists and capabilities
* Technical details and requirements
* Implementation considerations

=== Usage Examples
* Complete, working code examples
* Common use cases
* Configuration examples
* Best practice implementations
* Each example must have:
** Clear purpose explanation
** Complete code snippet
** Configuration if required
** Expected outcome

=== Configuration
* Available configuration options
* Property examples
* Configuration hierarchy
* Default values and fallbacks
* Environment-specific configurations

=== Best Practices
* Implementation guidelines
* Performance considerations
* Security aspects
* Common pitfalls to avoid
* Recommended patterns

=== Technical Details
* Thread safety considerations
* Memory impact
* Performance characteristics
* Implementation notes
* Dependencies and requirements

=== Related Documentation
* Links to specifications
* Related projects
* Additional resources
* External documentation

== Style Guidelines

=== Formatting
* Use asciidoc syntax consistently
* Maintain proper heading hierarchy
* Use code blocks with language specification
* Include line breaks between sections

=== Code Examples
* Must be complete and working
* Show configuration where relevant
* Use realistic variable names
* Include comments for complex logic
* Must be backed by an actual unit-test

=== Links
* Use relative paths for internal links
* Use absolute URLs for external resources
* Link to source files using asciidoc format
* Verify all links are valid

=== Configuration Examples
* Show all relevant properties
* Include default values
* Demonstrate override patterns
* Document configuration hierarchy

== Table of Contents Guidelines

=== AsciiDoc TOC Configuration
* Use the built-in AsciiDoc TOC mechanism instead of manual TOC creation
* Add the following attributes to the document header:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Document Title
:toc: macro
:toclevels: 3
:sectnumlevels: 1
----
* Place the TOC macro `toc::[]` after the introduction sections and before the main content

=== Excluding Sections from TOC
* Use the `[.discrete]` attribute for sections that should not appear in the TOC

[source,asciidoc]
----
[.discrete]
== Status

Project status badges and links
----
* Typically exclude status badges, build information, and other metadata sections

=== TOC Structure Best Practices
* Limit TOC to 3 levels for readability
* Use section numbering only for main content sections
* Ensure logical grouping of related topics
* Place Migration Guide and similar reference sections at the end
* Keep TOC focused on substantive documentation sections

=== Example TOC Implementation
