# Task 3: Update to Logging Testing Standards

This document provides detailed guidance for implementing Task 3 of the CUI JSF Components maintenance plan: updating logging tests to comply with CUI logging testing standards.

## Overview

The goal of this task is to ensure all logging tests across the CUI JSF Components project follow the established CUI logging testing standards. This includes updating test implementations to properly verify logging behavior using the recommended tools and patterns.

## Pre-conditions

- Logging tests may not follow CUI logging testing standards
- Tests may not use the recommended cui-test-juli-logger
- Log message verification may be inconsistent or missing
- Tests may not properly verify log levels and message content

## Post-conditions

- All logging tests follow CUI logging testing standards
- cui-test-juli-logger is used consistently
- Log message verification is comprehensive
- No other aspects of the code have been modified

## Logging Testing Standards

The following standards should be applied to all logging tests:

### Test Logger Configuration

- Use cui-test-juli-logger for logger testing
- Apply `@EnableTestLogger` annotation to test classes
- Configure appropriate log levels for tests

### Log Message Verification

- Use assertLogMessagePresentContaining for testing log messages
- Verify both the presence and content of log messages
- Check that log levels are appropriate for different scenarios
- Test error logging with exception handling

### Test Structure

- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in logging test methods
- Clearly separate the logging action from the verification
- Use descriptive method names for logging tests
- Group related logging tests using nested test classes

## Implementation Process

For implementing this task, follow the refactoring process:

### 1. Analysis Phase

- Review current state of the module's logging tests
- Identify gaps between current implementation and standards
- Document specific issues to be addressed

### 2. Planning Phase

- Define specific changes needed for each test class
- Prioritize tests based on importance and complexity
- Estimate effort required

### 3. Implementation Phase

- Make the necessary changes to logging tests
- Follow the pre and post conditions strictly
- Keep changes focused on the specific task
- Do not modify other aspects of the code

### 4. Verification Phase

- Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved
- Verify that standards are now being followed
- Document any remaining issues

## Progress Tracking

For each module, progress should be tracked in the module-specific maintenance document:

- **Not Started**: Task has not been initiated
- **In Progress**: Task is currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Task has been completed and verified
- **Blocked**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues
