4. **Verification Phase**: Run tests and verify standards compliance

## CSS-Specific Guidelines

As a web module containing CSS resources rather than Java code, the following guidelines apply:

1. **Testing Standards**
   - Use appropriate CSS testing frameworks (Cypress, Storybook, etc.)
   - Implement visual regression testing
   - Test responsive design across various screen sizes
   - Test browser compatibility across major browsers
   - Verify integration with JSF components

2. **Logging Standards**
   - Implement appropriate logging for CSS-related JavaScript code
   - Log style loading and application issues
   - Define appropriate log levels for CSS-related issues
   - Ensure logging doesn't impact performance

3. **Documentation Standards**
   - Create comprehensive style guide
   - Document CSS architecture and organization
   - Document responsive design implementation
   - Include usage examples for key styles
   - Document theme customization options

4. **Code Quality Standards**
   - Follow CSS best practices
   - Use CSS linting tools
   - Implement consistent naming conventions
   - Optimize for performance
   - Ensure browser compatibility
   - Consider using CSS preprocessors (Sass, Less) for maintainability

## Progress Tracking

Progress on tasks is tracked using the following status indicators:
