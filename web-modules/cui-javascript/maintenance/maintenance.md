## Implementation Strategy

For each task, follow the refactoring process:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Review current state and identify gaps
2. **Planning Phase**: Define specific changes needed
3. **Implementation Phase**: Make the necessary changes
4. **Verification Phase**: Run tests and verify standards compliance

## JavaScript-Specific Guidelines

As a web module containing JavaScript resources rather than Java code, the following guidelines apply:

1. **Testing Standards**
   - Use modern JavaScript testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, etc.)
   - Implement both unit and integration tests
   - Test browser compatibility across major browsers
   - Use mocking libraries for external dependencies
   - Implement code coverage reporting

2. **Logging Standards**
   - Use a consistent JavaScript logging framework
   - Define appropriate log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
   - Implement structured logging where possible
   - Ensure logging doesn't impact performance
   - Consider privacy and security in client-side logging

3. **Documentation Standards**
   - Use JSDoc for API documentation
   - Document all public functions, classes, and modules
   - Include examples in documentation
   - Generate API documentation using appropriate tools
   - Document browser compatibility

4. **Code Quality Standards**
   - Follow modern JavaScript best practices
   - Use ESLint for code quality enforcement
   - Consider using TypeScript for type safety
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Follow performance best practices

## Progress Tracking

Progress on tasks is tracked using the following status indicators:

- **Not Started**: Task has not been initiated
- **In Progress**: Task is currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Task has been completed and verified
- **Blocked**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues

Update the status checkboxes at the beginning of each task as progress is made. For subtasks, check the boxes as they are completed.
