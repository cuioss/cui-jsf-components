# Maintenance Scheme for CUI JSF Components

This document provides an overview of the maintenance tasks for all modules in the CUI JSF Components project. Each module has its own maintenance document with specific tasks and guidelines.

## Modules Overview

### Core Modules
1. [cui-jsf-api](modules/cui-jsf-api/maintenance.md) - Core API module
2. [cui-jsf-bootstrap](modules/cui-jsf-bootstrap/maintenance.md) - Bootstrap integration module
3. [cui-jsf-core-components](modules/cui-jsf-core-components/maintenance.md) - Core JSF components
4. [cui-jsf-dev](modules/cui-jsf-dev/maintenance.md) - Development utilities
5. [cui-jsf-jqplot](modules/cui-jsf-jqplot/maintenance.md) - JQPlot integration
6. [cui-jsf-test](modules/cui-jsf-test/maintenance.md) - Testing utilities

### Web Modules
7. [cui-javascript](web-modules/cui-javascript/maintenance.md) - JavaScript resources
8. [cui-jsf-bootstrap-css](web-modules/cui-jsf-bootstrap-css/maintenance.md) - Bootstrap CSS resources

## Maintenance Tasks

Each module has the following maintenance tasks defined:

1. **Update Unit Tests to Comply with Standards**
   - Pre-conditions: Existing unit tests may not fully comply with testing standards
   - Post-conditions: All unit tests follow the CUI testing standards
   - No production code changes during this task

2. **Update Production Code to Logging Standards**
   - Pre-conditions: Logging implementation may not follow CUI logging standards
   - Post-conditions: All logging in production code follows CUI logging standards
   - No other changes to production code during this task

3. **Update to Logging Testing Standards**
   - Pre-conditions: Logging tests may not follow CUI logging testing standards
   - Post-conditions: All logging tests follow CUI logging testing standards
   - No other changes during this task

4. **Update Javadoc to Comply with Standards**
   - Pre-conditions: Existing Javadoc may not follow CUI documentation standards
   - Post-conditions: All Javadoc follows the CUI documentation standards
   - Documentation is complete for all public classes, methods, and interfaces
   - No functional code changes during this task

5. **Create README According to Standards**
   - Pre-conditions: Module may not have a standardized README or it may be incomplete
   - Post-conditions: Each module has a README file following the CUI README structure
   - README provides clear information about the module's purpose, usage, and features
   - No code changes during this task

6. **Analyze Code for Refactoring Opportunities**
   - Pre-conditions: Code may have areas that could benefit from refactoring
   - Post-conditions: A refactoring document is created for each module
   - Document identifies specific refactoring opportunities with justifications
   - No actual code changes during this task

## Refactoring Process

For each maintenance task, the following process should be followed:

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Review current state of the module
   - Identify gaps between current implementation and standards
   - Document specific issues to be addressed

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Define specific changes needed
   - Estimate effort required
   - Identify potential risks

3. **Implementation Phase**
   - Make the necessary changes
   - Follow the pre and post conditions strictly
   - Keep changes focused on the specific task

4. **Verification Phase**
   - Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved
   - Verify that standards are now being followed
   - Document any remaining issues

## Task Completion Process

For each maintenance task, ensure the following:
   - Task execution follows a standardized process
   - Each task follows the defined completion process
   - Progress tracking is implemented for all tasks
   - No code changes are made outside the scope of the task

## Progress Tracking

For each module and task, progress should be tracked using the following status indicators:

- **Not Started**: Task has not been initiated
- **In Progress**: Task is currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Task has been completed and verified
- **Blocked**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues

Progress updates should be documented in the module-specific maintenance documents with dates and responsible individuals.
