 * The defined object structure represent the jqPlot JavaScript API. This allow
 * to configure needed Graph dynamic, because the whole graph model could be
 * defined on runtime if needed. In this way the full jqPlot JavaScript API
 * could be used without a need of static graph configuration or error-prone
 * manual build of JSON objects. The model is based on
 * {@link de.cuioss.jsf.jqplot.js} defined classes which already provide a easy
 * way for JSON transformation.
