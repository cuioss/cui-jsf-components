#### Pre-conditions
- Logging tests may not follow CUI logging testing standards
- Tests may not use the recommended cui-test-juli-logger
- Log message verification may be inconsistent or missing
- Bootstrap-specific logging tests may be inadequate

#### Task Description
- [ ] Implement @EnableTestLogger for logging tests
- [ ] Use assertLogMessagePresentContaining for testing log messages
- [ ] Ensure all log messages are properly tested
- [ ] Verify log levels are appropriate for different scenarios
- [ ] Implement comprehensive tests for Bootstrap-specific logging

#### Post-conditions
- All logging tests follow CUI logging testing standards
- cui-test-juli-logger is used consistently
- Log message verification is comprehensive
- Bootstrap-specific logging is properly tested
- No other aspects of the code have been modified

### 4. Update Javadoc to Comply with Standards

**Status**: [ ] Not Started [ ] In Progress [ ] Completed [ ] Blocked

#### Pre-conditions
- Existing Javadoc may not follow CUI documentation standards
- Documentation for Bootstrap components may be incomplete or outdated
- Javadoc formatting may be inconsistent
- Component behavior and attributes may not be fully documented

#### Task Description
- [ ] Review all existing Javadoc for Bootstrap components
- [ ] Update documentation to follow CUI Javadoc standards
- [ ] Ensure all public classes, methods, and interfaces are documented
- [ ] Include purpose statements in component documentation
- [ ] Document component attributes, behaviors, and events
- [ ] Add @since tags with version information
- [ ] Document responsive behavior considerations
- [ ] Include usage examples for components

#### Post-conditions
- All Javadoc follows CUI documentation standards
- Documentation is complete for all public classes, methods, and interfaces
- Component behavior and attributes are clearly documented
- Javadoc provides clear and useful information
- No functional code changes have been made during this task

### 5. Create README According to Standards

**Status**: [ ] Not Started [ ] In Progress [ ] Completed [ ] Blocked

#### Pre-conditions
- Module may not have a standardized README or it may be incomplete
- Information about Bootstrap integration may be lacking
- Component usage examples may be insufficient
- Responsive design documentation may be missing

#### Task Description
- [ ] Create or update README file following CUI README structure
- [ ] Include clear module description and purpose
- [ ] Document Bootstrap version compatibility
- [ ] Provide component usage examples
- [ ] Include responsive design guidelines
- [ ] Document theme customization options
- [ ] Add dependency information
- [ ] Include browser compatibility information

#### Post-conditions
- Module has a README file following the CUI README structure
- README provides clear information about Bootstrap integration
- Documentation includes component usage examples
- Responsive design guidelines are documented
- No code changes have been made during this task

### 6. Analyze Code for Refactoring Opportunities

**Status**: [ ] Not Started [ ] In Progress [ ] Completed [ ] Blocked

#### Pre-conditions
- Code may have areas that could benefit from refactoring
- Technical debt may exist in various parts of the module
- Component structure may not follow best practices in all areas
- Performance optimizations for responsive components may be possible

#### Task Description
- [ ] Review code for compliance with Java code standards
- [ ] Identify areas with technical debt
- [ ] Look for code duplication in component implementations
- [ ] Assess component class hierarchy and complexity
- [ ] Evaluate renderer implementations
- [ ] Check for potential performance improvements in responsive components
- [ ] Document all refactoring opportunities with justifications

#### Post-conditions
- A refactoring document is created for the module
- Document identifies specific refactoring opportunities with justifications
- Potential improvements are prioritized
- No actual code changes have been made during this task

## Implementation Strategy

For each task, follow the refactoring process:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Review current state and identify gaps
2. **Planning Phase**: Define specific changes needed
3. **Implementation Phase**: Make the necessary changes
4. **Verification Phase**: Run tests and verify standards compliance

## Progress Tracking

Progress on tasks is tracked using the following status indicators:

- **Not Started**: Task has not been initiated
- **In Progress**: Task is currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Task has been completed and verified
- **Blocked**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues

Update the status checkboxes at the beginning of each task as progress is made. For subtasks, check the boxes as they are completed.
