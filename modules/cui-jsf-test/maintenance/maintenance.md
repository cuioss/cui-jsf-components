#### Task Description
- [ ] Implement @EnableTestLogger for logging tests
- [ ] Use assertLogMessagePresentContaining for testing log messages
- [ ] Ensure all log messages are properly tested
- [ ] Verify log levels are appropriate for different scenarios

- [ ] Test logging for test utilities and mock objects

#### Post-conditions
- All logging tests follow CUI logging testing standards

- Usage examples for testing utilities may be lacking

#### Task Description
- [ ] Review all existing Javadoc for testing utilities
- [ ] Update documentation to follow CUI Javadoc standards
- [ ] Ensure all public classes, methods, and interfaces are documented
- [ ] Include purpose statements in testing utility documentation
- [ ] Document mock objects and test helpers thoroughly
- [ ] Document test utility configuration options
- [ ] Add @since tags with version information
- [ ] Include usage examples for testing utilities
- [ ] Document best practices for using the testing framework

#### Post-conditions
- All Javadoc follows CUI documentation standards
- Documentation is complete for all public classes, methods, and interfaces
- Mock objects and test helpers are clearly documented
- Test utility configuration options are well-documented
- Javadoc provides clear and useful information with examples
- No functional code changes have been made during this task

### 5. Create README According to Standards

**Status**: [ ] Not Started [ ] In Progress [x] Completed [ ] Blocked

#### Pre-conditions
- Module may not have a standardized README or it may be incomplete
- Information about the module's purpose and usage may be lacking
- Installation and configuration instructions may be missing
- Examples and API documentation may be insufficient

#### Task Description
- [x] Create or update README file following CUI README structure
- [x] Include clear module description and purpose
- [x] Document installation and configuration instructions
- [x] Provide usage examples

### 6. Analyze Code for Refactoring Opportunities

**Status**: [ ] Not Started [ ] In Progress [ ] Completed [ ] Blocked

#### Pre-conditions
- Code may have areas that could benefit from refactoring
- Technical debt may exist in various parts of the module
- Testing utility structure may not follow best practices in all areas
- Performance optimizations for test execution may be possible
- Mock object implementations may need improvements

#### Task Description
- [ ] Review code for compliance with Java code standards
- [ ] Identify areas with technical debt

- [ ] Document all refactoring opportunities with justifications

#### Post-conditions
- A refactoring document is created for the module
- Document identifies specific refactoring opportunities with justifications
- Potential improvements are prioritized
- No actual code changes have been made during this task

## Implementation Strategy

For each task, follow the refactoring process:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Review current state and identify gaps
2. **Planning Phase**: Define specific changes needed
3. **Implementation Phase**: Make the necessary changes
4. **Verification Phase**: Run tests and verify standards compliance

## Progress Tracking

Progress on tasks is tracked using the following status indicators:

- **Not Started**: Task has not been initiated
- **In Progress**: Task is currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Task has been completed and verified
- **Blocked**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues

Update the status checkboxes at the beginning of each task as progress is made. For subtasks, check the boxes as they are completed.
