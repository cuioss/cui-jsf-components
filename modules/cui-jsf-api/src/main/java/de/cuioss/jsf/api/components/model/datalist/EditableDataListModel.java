/**
 * <h2>Core interface for managing editable data lists in JSF components</h2>
 * <p>
 * This interface defines the contract for model classes that support the EditableDataListComponent.
 * It provides functionality for:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Creating, editing, and deleting items in a list</li>
 * <li>Managing the state of items (new, modified, deleted)</li>
 * <li>Tracking changes to the model</li>
 * <li>Supporting undo operations for deletions</li>
 * <li>Providing different views of the data (all items, deleted items, result items)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Implementations should handle the complexities of item state management and ensure
 * proper synchronization between display items, deleted items, and the final result items.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> identifying the type of items to be managed. Must be at least
 *            {@link Serializable} and implement {@link Object#hashCode()} and
 *            {@link Object#equals(Object)} correctly to ensure proper tracking of changes.
