/**
 * <h2>Interface for menu separator items</h2>
 * <p>
 * This interface represents separator elements within a navigation menu. Separators are
 * non-interactive elements that visually divide groups of related menu items, typically
 * rendered as horizontal lines or dividers in dropdown menus.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Key characteristics of menu separators:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Visual dividers with no interactive functionality</li>
 * <li>Used to group related menu items</li>
 * <li>Positioned between menu items based on their order property</li>
 * <li>Stateless elements that can be reused throughout a menu</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Since separators are stateless and functionally identical, the implementation
 * {@link NavigationMenuItemSeparatorImpl} provides a singleton-pattern factory method
 * {@link NavigationMenuItemSeparatorImpl#getInstance(Integer)} to avoid creating
 * redundant instances.
 * </p>
