/**
 * <h2>Summary</h2>
 * <p>
 * Implementors of this class manage the state and resolving of the title
 * attribute. The implementation relies on the correct user of the attribute
 * names, saying they must exactly match the accessor methods.
 * </p>
 * <h2>titleKey</h2>
 * <p>
 * The key for looking up the text for the title-attribute. Although this
 * attribute is not required you must provide either this or #titleValue if you
 * want a title to be displayed.
 * </p>
 * <h2>titleValue</h2>
 * <p>
 * The Object displayed for the title-attribute. This is a replacement for
 * #titleKey. If both are present titleValue takes precedence. This object is
 * usually a String. If not, the developer must ensure that a corresponding
 * converter is either registered for the type or must provide a converter using
 * #titleConverter.
 * </p>
 * <h2>titleConverter</h2>
 * <p>
 * The optional converterId to be used in case of titleValue is set and needs
 * conversion.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Update to the state-management</h2>
 * In previous versions targeted at mojarra, the logic of modifying the final title was in the method
 * {@link #resolveTitle()}}.
 * With myfaces on the other hand the default Renderer use {@link UIComponent#getAttributes()} for looking up the
 * title.
 * <p>
 * The Solution: {@link #resolveAndStoreTitle()} must be called prior rendering.
 * This must be done prior Rendering, usually by the concrete {@link jakarta.faces.render.Renderer}
 * <em>This workaround is only necessary for cases, where the rendering is done by the concrete implementation.</em>
 * </p>
