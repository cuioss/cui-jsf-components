/**
 * <h2>Component Models Package</h2>
 * <p>
 * Provides the model interfaces and implementations for the CUI JSF component system.
 * This package forms the foundation of the component model architecture, defining
 * the core abstractions, contracts, and implementations that enable the creation
 * of reusable, composable UI components.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Package Structure</h3>
 * <p>
 * This package is organized into several sub-packages, each focusing on a specific
 * aspect of the component model system:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code widget} - Models for widget-based components used in dashboards and content areas</li>
 *   <li>{@code lazyloading} - Support for deferred content loading to improve performance</li>
 *   <li>{@code resultContent} - Handling of operation results and notifications</li>
 *   <li>{@code selection} - Support for selection operations in list-based components</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Design Principles</h3>
 * <p>
 * The component model system follows several key design principles:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong> - Clear distinction between model, view, and controller aspects</li>
 *   <li><strong>Composability</strong> - Models can be combined to create complex component behaviors</li>
 *   <li><strong>Consistent Patterns</strong> - Similar components share common patterns and interfaces</li>
 *   <li><strong>JSF Integration</strong> - Models work seamlessly with the JSF lifecycle and component model</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Usage Patterns</h3>
 * <p>
 * The models in this package are typically used in several ways:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>As backing models for JSF components and composite components</li>
 *   <li>As data transfer objects between application layers</li>
 *   <li>As part of view-scoped beans to maintain component state</li>
 *   <li>As extension points for custom component behavior</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Thread Safety Considerations</h3>
 * <p>
 * Models in this package have varying thread-safety characteristics:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Immutable value objects are generally thread-safe</li>
 *   <li>Stateful models should be used within appropriate JSF scopes</li>
 *   <li>Models that support asynchronous operations explicitly document their thread-safety guarantees</li>
 * </ul>
