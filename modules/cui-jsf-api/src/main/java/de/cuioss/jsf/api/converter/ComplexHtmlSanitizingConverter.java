/**
 * A specialized HTML sanitizing converter that allows a rich set of HTML formatting elements
 * while still protecting against XSS attacks.
 * <p>
 * This converter extends {@link HtmlSanitizingConverter} and pre-configures it to use the
 * {@link CuiSanitizer#COMPLEX_HTML_PRESERVE_ENTITIES} sanitization strategy, which allows
 * a wide variety of HTML formatting elements and attributes while still protecting against
 * potentially dangerous content.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This converter is ideal for rich text content that needs to preserve formatting such as:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Formatted text from rich text editors</li>
 *   <li>Content with complex formatting needs (tables, lists, headings, etc.)</li>
 *   <li>HTML content from trusted sources that still needs sanitization</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The converter allows HTML formatting elements like tables, lists, formatting tags, etc.
 * while still preventing script injection and other XSS vectors. It also preserves HTML
 * entities for special characters.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Usage example in JSF:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;h:outputText value="#{bean.richTextContent}" 
 *               converter="cui.converter.ComplexHtmlSanitizingConverter" 
 *               escape="false" /&gt;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note: When using this converter, it's important to set {@code escape="false"} on the
 * output component to allow the formatted HTML to render properly.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Security Note: While this converter provides strong protection against XSS attacks,
 * it allows more HTML than stricter sanitizers. Only use it for content where rich 
 * formatting is required.
