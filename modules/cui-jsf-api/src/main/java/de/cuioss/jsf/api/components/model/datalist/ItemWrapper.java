 * <h2>Wrapper for items in an editable data list</h2>
 * <p>
 * An {@link ItemWrapper} encapsulates a concrete object and provides additional metadata
 * and operations for managing the item within an editable list context. It tracks:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The item's position in the list</li>
 * <li>The item's current edit status</li>
 * <li>The original state of the item for comparison and potential rollback</li>
 * <li>Addition status for newly created items</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This interface provides methods to manipulate the item's state, such as entering
 * edit mode, saving changes, canceling edits, and marking items for deletion.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> identifying the type of items to be wrapped. Must be at least
 *            {@link Serializable} and implement {@link Object#hashCode()} and
 *            {@link Object#equals(Object)} correctly to ensure proper tracking of changes.
