/**
 * Extension of {@link LazyLoadingModel} that supports asynchronous content loading in a separate thread.
 * <p>
 * This interface adds functionality for managing asynchronous loading operations by providing:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Request identification for tracking asynchronous operations</li>
 *   <li>Result handling for both successful and error outcomes</li>
 *   <li>Notification box management for displaying messages</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The asynchronous loading pattern typically involves:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A component initiates a loading request with a unique ID</li>
 *   <li>The loading operation runs in a background thread</li>
 *   <li>When complete, the result is passed back to this model via {@link #handleRequestResult}</li>
 *   <li>The component displays either the loaded content or an error message</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * This model helps manage the complexities of asynchronous loading while providing
 * hooks for both success and error scenarios.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: Classes implementing this interface must ensure thread safety
 * since they will be accessed from multiple threads.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of content being loaded asynchronously

 * @since 1.0
