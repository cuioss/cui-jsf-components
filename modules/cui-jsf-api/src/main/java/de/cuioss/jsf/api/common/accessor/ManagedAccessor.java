 * <ul>
 * <li>Failsafe implementation of {@link Serializable} / transient contract</li>
 * <li>Implicit lazy loading of the Attributes / beans / whatever
 * <li>Hiding of the loading mechanics of the object to be loaded.</li>
 * <li>Unifying usage of common objects like {@link ResourceBundle}, etc.</li>
