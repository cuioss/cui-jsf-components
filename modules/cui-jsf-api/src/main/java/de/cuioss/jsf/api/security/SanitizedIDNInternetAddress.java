/**
 * Utility class for safely handling Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) in email addresses.
 * <p>
 * This class provides methods to encode and decode email addresses with internationalized
 * domain names, while applying security sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
 * It wraps the functionality provided by {@link de.cuioss.tools.net.IDNInternetAddress}
 * and applies {@link CuiSanitizer#PLAIN_TEXT} sanitization to all operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Internationalized Domain Names allow for non-ASCII characters in domain names,
 * such as those used in many non-Latin writing systems. This class supports processing
 * these domain names in accordance with the IDN standards (RFC 3490) with additional
 * security measures.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * // Encode an email address with IDN domain
 * String encoded = SanitizedIDNInternetAddress.encode("user@例子.com");
 * 
 * // Decode an encoded email address back to its Unicode form
 * String decoded = SanitizedIDNInternetAddress.decode("user@xn--fsqu00a.com");
 * </pre>
