This document describes the concept and members of the `de.cuioss.jsf.api.components.decorator` package, which provides a framework for decorating JSF components using the decorator pattern.

toc::[]

== Overview

The decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. In the context of JSF components, decorators are a specialized type of attached objects that enhance or modify other components in the component tree, typically their parent component.

The key difference from `ClientBehavior` is that decorators don't react to client interactions but instead enhance or modify other components in the component tree, typically their parent component.

== AbstractParentDecorator

The core class in the decorator package is `AbstractParentDecorator`, which serves as the base class for creating decorators that modify their parent component.

[source,java]
----
public abstract class AbstractParentDecorator extends UIComponentBase implements ComponentBridge {

    /**
     * Decorates the parent component.
     * This method is called during the component tree building phase.
     * 
     * @param parent the parent component to decorate
     */
    protected abstract void decorate(UIComponent parent);

    /**
     * Called by the JSF lifecycle when the component is added to the view.
     * This method triggers the decoration process.
     */
    @Override
    public void setParent(UIComponent parent) {
        if (null != parent) {
            decorate(parent);
        }
        super.setParent(parent);
    }

    // Other methods...
}
----

The key method is `decorate(UIComponent parent)`, which subclasses must implement to apply their specific modifications to the parent component. The decoration is automatically applied when the component is added to the view through the `setParent` method.

== Integration with Component Modifiers

The decorator pattern integrates with the component modifier framework through the `ComponentModifier` interface. This allows decorators to use the same modification mechanisms as other parts of the framework.

[source,java]
----
protected void decorate(UIComponent parent) {
    ComponentModifier modifier = ComponentModifierFactory.findFittingWrapper(parent);
    if (null != modifier) {
        // Apply modifications using the modifier
        modifier.addStyleClass(parent, "decorated-component");
    }
}
----

This integration ensures consistent behavior across the framework and simplifies the implementation of decorators.

== Usage Pattern

Decorators are typically placed inside the component they should decorate:

[source,xml]
----
<h:commandButton value="Click Me">
    <cui:tooltip title="Click this button to submit the form" placement="top"/>
</h:commandButton>
----

When the view is rendered, the decorator modifies its parent component (in this case, adding tooltip functionality to the `commandButton`).

== Common Decorator Types

=== Tooltip Decorators

Add tooltip functionality to the parent component:

[source,java]
----
public class TooltipComponent extends AbstractParentDecorator {

    private String placement;
    private String trigger;
    private Integer delay;
    private String content;

    @Override
    public void decorate(final ComponentModifier parent) {
        parent.addPassThrough("data-placement", getPlacement())
                .addPassThrough("data-toggle", "tooltip")
                .addPassThrough("data-trigger", getTrigger())
                .addPassThrough("data-delay", getDelay());

        if (null != content) {
            if (parent.isSupportsTitle()) {
                parent.setTitle(content);
            } else {
                parent.addPassThrough("title", content);
            }
        }
    }

    // Getters and setters...
}
----

=== Modal Control Decorators

Add modal dialog control functionality to the parent component:

[source,java]
----
public class ModalControl extends AbstractParentDecorator {

    private String forId;
    private String event;
    private String action;

    @Override
    public void decorate(final ComponentModifier parent) {
        parent.addPassThrough("data-modal-for", getFor())
              .addPassThrough("data-modal-action", getAction())
              .addPassThrough("data-modal-event", getEvent());
    }

    // Getters and setters...
}
----

=== Block Element Decorators

Add block element functionality to the parent component:

[source,java]
----
public class BlockElementDecorator extends AbstractParentDecorator {

    @Override
    public void decorate(ComponentModifier parent) {
        parent.addPassThrough("data-cui-block-element", "data-cui-block-element");
    }
}
----

== Examples from the Framework

[source,xml]
----
<h:commandButton value="Click Me">
    <cui:tooltip title="Click this button to submit the form" placement="top"/>
</h:commandButton>
----

Usage:

[source,xml]
----
<h:inputText value="#{bean.searchTerm}">
    <cui:typewatch wait="500" listener="#{bean.search}"/>
</h:inputText>
----

== Implementation Guidelines

When implementing custom decorators, follow these guidelines:

1. **Extend AbstractParentDecorator**: Always extend the `AbstractParentDecorator` base class.
2. **Implement decorate() Method**: Provide a clear implementation of the `decorate(UIComponent parent)` method.
3. **Use Component Modifiers**: Leverage the component modifier framework for consistent behavior.
4. **Handle Null Cases**: Be defensive in your implementation, checking for null values and appropriate component types.
5. **Document Decorator Behavior**: Clearly document what modifications your decorator applies.
6. **Consider Performance**: Decorators are executed during view building, so keep performance in mind.

== Best Practices

=== When to Use Decorators

Decorators are ideal for:

* Adding CSS classes or styles to components
* Setting HTML attributes on components
* Adding client behaviors (like AJAX) to components
* Configuring component properties in a reusable way

=== When Not to Use Decorators

Decorators may not be appropriate for:

* Complex component transformations that require access to the component's children
* Modifications that need to happen at render time rather than view build time
* Changes that depend on the component's state during the JSF lifecycle

=== Decorator vs. Component Wrapper

Consider the differences between decorators and component wrappers:

* **Decorators**: Modify existing components without changing their type or core behavior
* **Wrappers**: Replace components with enhanced versions that may change behavior significantly

Choose the appropriate pattern based on your requirements.

== Lifecycle Considerations

Decorators operate during the view building phase of the JSF lifecycle, specifically when components are added to the component tree. This means:

1. Decorations are applied before the component is rendered
2. Decorations persist for the lifetime of the view
3. Decorations are not re-applied during AJAX requests unless the component is rebuilt

Be aware of these lifecycle implications when designing decorators.

== Thread Safety

Classes in the decorator package generally depend on the JSF lifecycle and are therefore not thread-safe by design, as they are intended to be used within the context of a single request.

== Conclusion

The decorator pattern provides a powerful way to enhance JSF components without requiring complex inheritance hierarchies or custom component implementations. By using decorators, you can:

* Keep component implementations focused on core functionality
* Apply cross-cutting concerns in a modular way
* Create reusable enhancements that can be applied to multiple component types
* Maintain a clean separation between component behavior and presentation details

The `de.cuioss.jsf.api.components.decorator` package in the CUI JSF API provides the foundation for implementing this pattern in a consistent and maintainable way.
