# Javadoc Standards Implementation Plan for cui-jsf-api

This document outlines the implementation plan for updating Javadoc in the cui-jsf-api module to comply with CUI documentation standards.

## Current Status

- **Total Files**: 215
- **Compliant Files**: 2 (0.9%)
- **Remaining Files**: 213 (99.1%)

## Implementation Approach

We'll use a phased approach to systematically update all Javadoc in the cui-jsf-api module:

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning

1. Identify the 2 files that already comply with standards to understand the correct implementation
2. Review files to identify common Javadoc issues
3. Create templates for common class types (interfaces, abstract classes, utilities, etc.)
4. Prioritize files based on their importance and dependencies
5. Group files by package for easier tracking

### Phase 2: Implementation

#### Iteration 1: Package-Info Files
- Create or update package-info.java files for all packages
- Ensure package documentation describes purpose and key components

#### Iteration 2: Core Interfaces and Base Classes
- Update documentation for key interfaces and base classes
- These are foundational elements used throughout the module

#### Iteration 3: Component Classes
- Update documentation for component classes
- Focus on public methods, parameters, return values, and exceptions

#### Iteration 4: Utility and Helper Classes
- Update documentation for utility and helper classes
- Include usage examples where appropriate

#### Iteration 5: Remaining Classes
- Address any remaining classes

### Phase 3: Verification and Validation

1. Run Javadoc generation to identify any errors
2. Verify that documentation meets standards
3. Check cross-references and links
4. Update status tracking in code.md files

## Javadoc Standards Checklist

For each file, ensure:

- [ ] Package has package-info.java with description and key components
- [ ] Class/interface has clear purpose statement
- [ ] @since tag with version information is included
- [ ] Thread-safety guarantees are specified
- [ ] Serialization is documented if applicable
- [ ] Public methods have:
  - [ ] Parameter documentation with @param tags
  - [ ] Return value documentation with @return tags
  - [ ] Exception documentation with @throws tags
- [ ] Public and protected fields are documented
- [ ] Usage examples are provided for complex classes/methods
- [ ] HTML formatting is correct (tags closed, proper nesting)
- [ ] No "stating the obvious" comments
- [ ] Links to related classes/methods are included where appropriate

## Javadoc Templates and Guidelines

Based on the analysis of compliant files like `CuiVersionLoggerEventListener.java`, the following templates should be used when updating Javadoc:

### Class/Interface Template

```java
/**
 * [Clear purpose statement - what does the class/interface do].
 * <p>
 * [Additional details about functionality, usage context, etc.]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [Thread-safety statement, e.g., "This class is thread-safe as it contains no mutable state."]
 * </p>
 *
 * @author [Author name]
 * @since [Initial version, e.g., 1.0]
 */
```

### Method Template

```java
/**
 * [Clear description of what the method does - not just repeating the method name].
 * <p>
 * [Additional details about functionality, edge cases, etc.]
 * </p>
 *
 * @param paramName [Description of parameter - constraints, usage, not null status]
 * @return [Description of return value - meaning, constraints, not null status]
 * @throws ExceptionType [When/why the exception is thrown]
 * @see [Related class/method references]
 */
```

### Field Template

```java
/**
 * [Purpose and usage of the field - not just repeating the field name].
 * [Include constraints, validation rules, etc.]
 */
```

### Thread-Safety Statements

Depending on the class characteristics, use one of these thread-safety statements:

1. **Immutable classes:**
   ```
   This class is thread-safe as it is immutable.
   ```

2. **No mutable state:**
   ```
   This class is thread-safe as it contains no mutable state.
   ```

3. **Synchronized access:**
   ```
   This class is thread-safe. All mutable operations are synchronized.
   ```

4. **Not thread-safe:**
   ```
   This class is not thread-safe. External synchronization is required when used concurrently.
   ```

5. **Conditionally thread-safe:**
   ```
   This class is conditionally thread-safe. [Specific conditions for thread-safety]
   ```

### Standard Phrases for Common Patterns

1. **Builder pattern:**
   ```
   This class implements the Builder pattern for creating [Class] instances.
   ```

2. **Factory methods:**
   ```
   Factory method that creates [Class] instances based on [criteria].
   ```

3. **Nullable values:**
   ```
   May return null if [condition].
   ```
   ```
   Never returns null.
   ```

4. **Parameter constraints:**
   ```
   Must not be null.
   ```
   ```
   Must be positive/negative/non-empty/valid [type].
   ```

### Documentation Dos and Don'ts

#### Do:
- Explain "why" and "how" rather than just "what"
- Document constraints, edge cases, and preconditions
- Use {@link} to reference related classes and methods
- Include examples for complex behaviors
- Document thread-safety considerations

#### Don't:
- Repeat the method/class name in the description
- State the obvious (e.g., "Gets the name" for a getName() method)
- Add trivial comments that provide no value
- Use ambiguous terms like "the parameter" instead of naming it
- Leave standard tags (@param, @return, @throws) undocumented

## Progress Tracking

Progress will be updated in the existing code.md files:
1. [Application and Common Packages](code-application-common.md)
2. [Components Package](code-components.md)
3. [Composite, Converter, Security, and Servlet Packages](code-remaining.md)

Files will be marked with "javadoc" status when updated to comply with standards.
