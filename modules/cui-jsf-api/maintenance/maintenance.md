# Maintenance Plan for cui-jsf-api Module

This document outlines the maintenance tasks for the cui-jsf-api module, which serves as the core API for the CUI JSF Components project.

## Module Overview

The cui-jsf-api module provides the fundamental interfaces, classes, and utilities that form the foundation of the CUI JSF Components framework.

## Maintenance Tasks

### 1. Update Unit Tests to Comply with Standards

**Status**: [ ] Not Started [ ] In Progress [x] Completed [ ] Blocked

#### Pre-conditions
- Existing unit tests may not follow CUI testing standards
- Test coverage may be insufficient
- Test naming conventions may be inconsistent
- Tests may not use the recommended JUnit 5 features
- Mocking and stubbing approaches may vary

#### Task Description
- [x] Review all existing unit tests
- [x] Update tests to use JUnit 5 annotations and features
- [x] Ensure tests follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- [x] Implement nested test classes for better organization
- [x] Use descriptive method names for tests
- [x] Ensure tests are independent and don't rely on execution order
- [x] Aim for at least 80% line coverage

#### Detailed Progress Tracking
A detailed list of all test classes and their current status is maintained in [unit-tests.md](unit-tests.md). This document tracks which tests have been:
- **Analyzed**: The test has been reviewed but not yet updated
- **Completed**: The test has been updated to comply with standards
- **NoChanges**: The test already complies with standards or no changes are needed

For comprehensive guidance on implementing this task, refer to the [Task 1: Update Unit Tests to Comply with Standards](../../../maintenance/task1-unit-tests.md) document.

#### Documentation Guidelines
- Use `@DisplayName` annotations for test classes and methods to provide clear descriptions
- Avoid excessive Javadoc that merely states the obvious - `@DisplayName` is sufficient in most cases
- Class-level Javadoc should be minimal and not duplicate information from the class being tested
- Only add method-level Javadoc for helper/utility methods where the purpose isn't obvious

#### Current Progress Summary
- Total Test Classes: 120+
- Analyzed: 120+
- Completed: 116+
- NoChanges: 4
- Remaining: 0

#### Post-conditions
- All unit tests follow CUI testing standards
- Tests use JUnit 5 features consistently
- Test coverage meets or exceeds 80%
- Tests are well-organized and follow consistent patterns
- No production code has been modified during this task

#### Task Description
- [ ] Replace existing logger implementations with CuiLogger
- [ ] Implement structured logging with dedicated message constants
- [ ] Follow logging level ranges as per standards

#### Post-conditions
- All logging follows CUI logging standards
- CuiLogger is used consistently throughout the module
- Log messages follow the recommended format
- Log levels are used appropriately
- Exception handling in logging follows best practices
- No other aspects of the production code have been modified

### 3. Update to Logging Testing Standards

**Status**: [ ] Not Started [ ] In Progress [ ] Completed [ ] Blocked

#### Pre-conditions
- Logging tests may not follow CUI logging testing standards
- Tests may not use the recommended cui-test-juli-logger
- Log message verification may be inconsistent or missing

#### Task Description
- [ ] Implement @EnableTestLogger for logging tests
- [ ] Use assertLogMessagePresentContaining for testing log messages
- [ ] Ensure all log messages are properly tested
- [ ] Verify log levels are appropriate for different scenarios

#### Post-conditions
- All logging tests follow CUI logging testing standards
- cui-test-juli-logger is used consistently
- Log message verification is comprehensive
- No other aspects of the code have been modified

### 4. Update Javadoc to Comply with Standards

**Status**: [ ] Not Started [ ] In Progress [ ] Completed [ ] Blocked

#### Pre-conditions
- Existing Javadoc may not follow CUI documentation standards
- Documentation may be incomplete or outdated
- Javadoc formatting may be inconsistent
- Important details may be missing from documentation

#### Task Description
- [ ] Review all existing Javadoc
- [ ] Update documentation to follow CUI Javadoc standards
- [ ] Ensure all public classes, methods, and interfaces are documented
- [ ] Include purpose statements in class documentation
- [ ] Document parameters, returns, and exceptions
- [ ] Add @since tags with version information
- [ ] Document thread-safety considerations where applicable
- [ ] Include usage examples for complex classes and methods

#### Post-conditions
- All Javadoc follows CUI documentation standards
- Documentation is complete for all public classes, methods, and interfaces
- Javadoc provides clear and useful information
- No functional code changes have been made during this task

### 5. Create README According to Standards

**Status**: [ ] Not Started [ ] In Progress [ ] Completed [ ] Blocked

#### Pre-conditions
- Module may not have a standardized README or it may be incomplete
- Information about the module's purpose and usage may be lacking
- Installation and configuration instructions may be missing
- Examples and API documentation may be insufficient

#### Task Description
- [ ] Create or update README file following CUI README structure
- [ ] Include clear module description and purpose
- [ ] Document installation and configuration instructions
- [ ] Provide usage examples
- [ ] Include API documentation references
- [ ] Add dependency information
- [ ] Include contribution guidelines if applicable

#### Post-conditions
- Module has a README file following the CUI README structure
- README provides clear information about the module's purpose, usage, and features
- Documentation is comprehensive and user-friendly
- No code changes have been made during this task

### 6. Analyze Code for Refactoring Opportunities

**Status**: [ ] Not Started [x] In Progress [ ] Completed [ ] Blocked

#### Pre-conditions
- Code may have areas that could benefit from refactoring
- Technical debt may exist in various parts of the module
- Code structure may not follow best practices in all areas
- Performance optimizations may be possible

#### Task Description
- [ ] Review code for compliance with Java code standards
- [ ] Identify areas with technical debt
- [ ] Look for code duplication
- [ ] Assess class and method complexity
- [ ] Evaluate package structure and organization
- [ ] Check for potential performance improvements
- [ ] Document all refactoring opportunities with justifications

#### Post-conditions
- A refactoring document is created for the module
- Document identifies specific refactoring opportunities with justifications
- Potential improvements are prioritized
- No actual code changes have been made during this task

## Implementation Strategy

For each task, follow the refactoring process:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Review current state and identify gaps
2. **Planning Phase**: Define specific changes needed
3. **Implementation Phase**: Make the necessary changes
4. **Verification Phase**: Run tests and verify standards compliance

## Progress Tracking

Progress on tasks is tracked using the following status indicators:

- **Not Started**: Task has not been initiated
- **In Progress**: Task is currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Task has been completed and verified
- **Blocked**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues

Update the status checkboxes at the beginning of each task as progress is made. For subtasks, check the boxes as they are completed.
