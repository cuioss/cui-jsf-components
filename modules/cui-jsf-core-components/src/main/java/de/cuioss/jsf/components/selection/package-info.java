/**
 * <p>Provides classes for working with selection elements in JSF applications, particularly
 * focused on building and handling select menu models and converters.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This package offers several key capabilities:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Abstract base classes for creating select menu models with consistent behavior</li>
 *   <li>Implementation classes for common selection scenarios (enums, maps, concept keys)</li>
 *   <li>Integrated converter functionality for handling selection serialization/deserialization</li>
 *   <li>Support for both single-select and multi-select scenarios</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The selection components in this package are designed to work seamlessly with standard
 * JSF selection components like h:selectOneMenu and h:selectManyMenu, providing more
 * convenient and type-safe interfaces for populating selection options.</p>
